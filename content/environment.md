## `application`

Values inside the application section are used to create the HelmRelease and GitRepository CRs that manage deployment of the application into the cluster.

### `gitRepository`

Contains the needed details to create a GitRepository object in the cluster. All the fields present inside the [official GitRepository spec](https://fluxcd.io/docs/components/source/gitrepositories/) can be used here as well. The important fields are:

- **interval**: Interval at which the HelmRelease object will reconcile.
- **ref**: Reference to the branch, tag, semver or commit to clone
- **timeout**: Optional field to specify a timeout for Git operations like cloning.
- **URL**: Required field that specifies the HTTP/S or SSH address of the Git repository.
- **secretRef**: This field will be filled by Tronador using the [TronadorConfig](./tronador_config.md) CR. `secretRef` is used to specify a name reference to a Secret in the same namespace as the GitRepository, containing authentication credentials for the Git repository.

### `release`

Contains the needed details to create a HelmRelease object in the cluster. All the fields present inside the [official HelmRelease spec](https://fluxcd.io/docs/components/helm/helmreleases/) can be used here as well. The important fields are:

- **`chart`**: Spec for the HelmChart object that will be created by the HelmRelease. `chart.spec.chart` (relative path to chart in repo) and `chart.spec.sourceRef` (reference to the GitRepository object created by Tronador) are the important fields within this.
- **`interval`**: Interval at which the HelmRelease object will reconcile.
- **`releaseName`**: The name of the Helm release that will be deployed.
- **`valuesFrom`**: holds references to resources containing Helm values for this HelmRelease, and information about how they should be merged. For more details, see the [Official HelmRelease docs](https://fluxcd.io/legacy/helm-operator/helmrelease-guide/values/).
- **`values`**: The values that to override within the Helm release. These need to be updated whenever a new image is created for testing. Using the `create-environment` cluster task is recommended for this.

## `namespaceLabels`

Optional field that contains a map of all labels needed to be placed inside the namespace provisioned by the `Environment`. If they are removed from here, they will be removed from the namespace as well. Labels in the namespace that were never in this field will not be affected. A potential use case of this field is to allow compatibility with [Multi Tenant Operator](https://docs.stakater.com/mto/main/index.html).
